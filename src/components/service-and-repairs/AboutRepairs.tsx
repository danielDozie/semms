                    A request for repair can be submitted online or in a SEMMS Luxuries retail store. Once we receive your repair request, you will be sent an email confirming receipt. It then takes an average of two weeks to complete the repair process.

                    Please note, accessories are not eligible for repair but will be replaced if under warranty.
                    While international repairs can be submitted online or brought into a local SEMMS Luxuries retail store, they will only be serviced in the country where the repair request is submitted.
