                    We may share personal information that you provide to us through this Site or through this Site's Customer Service Department with our affiliates and service providers. In turn, our service providers may share this personal information with their affiliates and with service providers whom they engage to perform services related to this Site or the operation of our business. Examples of these services include Web Site operation, payment processing and authorization, fraud protection and credit risk reduction, product customization, order fulfilment and shipping, customer service, marketing and promotional material distribution, data analysis and, where applicable, data cleansing. These service providers are authorized to use this personal information only in connection with the services they are engaged to perform.<br /><br />

                    We may use the services of one or more third parties to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and determine how customers use this Site. To do this, we may use web beacons and cookies provided by third parties, which enable us to collect information such as product codes and prices for merchandise that customers purchase and the pages visited. This information helps us to learn things like what pages are most attractive to our customers, which of our products most interest our customers and what kinds of offers our customers like to see.<br /><br />

                    Our site may, from time to time, include third party advertising. We do not provide personal information to these third party advertisers; however, they may use technology to send the advertisements that appear on our Site to your browser. In this process, the third party advertiser automatically receives your IP address. They may also employ cookies and web beacons to measure the effectiveness of their own advertisements and personalize your interaction with them. We do not have access to or control over the cookies, web beacons or other technology they may use, and the information collected by these third party advertisers are not covered by this Privacy Policy. Please contact them directly for further information regarding their information privacy policies. For your reference, the Network Advertising Initiative offers useful information about internet advertising companies, including methods of "opting-out" of their information collection practices.<br /><br />

                    We also may offer you the opportunity to purchase products and services provided by third parties. If you purchase any of these products or services, we will provide your personal information to the third parties that provide them for that purpose.<br /><br />

                    We may release personal information if we believe in good faith that: the law or legal process requires it; we have received a valid administrative request from a law enforcement agency or court; or such release is necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of SEMMS, or any of our affiliates, service providers, customers or others.<br /><br />

                    We may share non-personal information with our marketing partners, advertisers and others from time to time. Examples of such non-personal information include the number of users who visited this Site during a specific time period or purchased a specific product through this Site. This information generally is shared in an aggregated form.<br /><br />
                    
                    As with any business, it is possible that as our business develops, we might sell or buy online stores or other assets. In such transactions, information about customers often is among the transferred assets. Accordingly, in the unlikely event that SEMMS, or substantially all of its assets related to this Site, is acquired by a third party, such information may be one of the transferred assets. Under such circumstances, SEMMS would to the extent possible require the acquiring party to follow the practices described in this Privacy Policy, as it may be amended from time to time.<br /><br />

                    By using this Site, you acknowledge and consent to the fact that personal information provided by you or collected by us through your use of the Site is stored and processed by us in the United States where data protection laws may not afford the same level of protection as those of the country in which you are located (this is the case for users located in the European Economic Area ("EEA")). You also acknowledge and consent to the fact that we may, at our discretion, store and process such data in other countries (including countries outside the EEA) where data protection laws may not afford the same level of protection as those of the country in which you are located.<br /><br />
